# K9 Golden Years Fountation - A Capstone Project for Savvy Coders

## About the Project

K9 Golden Years Foundation is a tech start-up in the ideation stage. The tech start-up's primary goal is to change lives of dogs in their golden years. We plan on doing this by developing technologies & software rescue organizations can use to implement on their own website. Eventually, we will have tutorials, APIs, and forms to help get rescues into the 21st century and beyond.

## Roadmap

[ ] Add Petfinder API
[ ] Create Form view
[ ] Create Tuturial view
[ ] Create an official logo

## Audience

The audience is currently students, teachers, mentors, friends, and family. Once the tech start-up goes live, the audience will be local rescues organizations, web developers, student business leaders, and dog lovers.
